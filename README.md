# Next JS Weather App

Hello! Welcome to the documentation of my recent project, a weather app built using Next JS and styled completely with Tailwind CSS. As I venture into the world of Next JS, I find it extremely beneficial to apply my knowledge through practical projects.

## Description

This application uses fetch to make API calls to [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/). The response from Open Weather Map comes in the form of JSON data which is then rendered on the screen. This project allowed me to explore several key concepts:

- **Conditional rendering in JavaScript**: This is a powerful feature in JavaScript that lets us render different elements depending on the state of the application. This was used extensively throughout this project.

- **Image component in Next JS**: Next JS provides a built-in Image component that optimizes how images are served. I utilized this component to ensure the app loads quickly and uses minimal bandwidth.

- **Tailwind CSS**: I utilized Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to style the application. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.

- **API calls**: I learned and implemented how to make API calls using fetch.

Feel free to explore the code and learn along with me on this journey of understanding Next JS, Tailwind CSS, and building API-based applications. Enjoy exploring the weather around the world!
